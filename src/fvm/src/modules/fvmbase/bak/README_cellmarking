<summary>
Build up Octree strcture for cell centroid;
Locate each MPM particle into background cells;
Mark cells as Fluid, Solid and IB types;
Set up and store connectivities for further use.

<script> --> cellMarking.py
	1. define Object of octree
	2. define Object of MPM
	3. call main function to finish all cellmarking work
	4. retrieve connectivity

<main function> CellMark_Impl()
	Note: search options
	options 1 and 2 can provide fast search
	options 3 and 4 are slow search by looping over all cells. Used for validation.
	In option 2, the radius needs to be pre-defined. 

<class Octree>
	1. Octree build up
	2. Octree search to find the nearest neighbor or neighbor list within a range

<class MPM>
	contains storagesite and particle coordinate and velocity
